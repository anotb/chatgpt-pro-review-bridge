# Troubleshooting

<!-- surface-drift:blocker-kind-coverage:start -->
## Blocker Kind Coverage

This section is checked by `npm run docs:drift`. Keep it aligned with `BlockerKind`, `explainCommandBlocker(...)`, command descriptors, and public troubleshooting coverage.

- `browser_bridge_unavailable`: Browser bridge unavailable (category: `environment`, severity: `blocked`, user action: no)
- `login_required`: Login required (category: `auth`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `captcha`: Captcha or human verification required (category: `auth`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `rate_limit`: Rate limited (category: `auth`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `model_unavailable`: Requested model unavailable (category: `model`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `model_fallback`: Model fallback detected (category: `model`, severity: `blocked`, user action: yes)
- `configuration_restore_failed`: Configuration restoration failed (category: `configuration`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `modal`: Modal is blocking the page (category: `runtime`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `permission`: Permission required (category: `permission`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `confirmation`: Confirmation required (category: `user_confirmation`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `selector_drift`: Selector drift (category: `ui_drift`, severity: `blocked`, user action: no)
- `artifact_unavailable`: Artifact unavailable (category: `artifact`, severity: `warning`, user action: no)
- `artifact_selector_drift`: Artifact selector drift (category: `ui_drift`, severity: `blocked`, user action: no)
- `artifact_download_unavailable`: Artifact download unavailable (category: `download`, severity: `warning`, user action: no)
- `download_unavailable`: Download unavailable (category: `download`, severity: `warning`, user action: no)
- `upload_failed`: Upload failed (category: `upload`, severity: `action_required`, user action: yes)
- `not_found`: Target not found (category: `not_found`, severity: `warning`, user action: no)
- `unknown`: Unknown blocker (category: `unknown`, severity: `blocked`, user action: no)

## `browser_bridge_unavailable`

Expected from ordinary shells. Use it as a diagnostic that the command failed safely before touching browser state.

For a real browser run, verify:

- Chrome is open and signed in to ChatGPT.
- The host runtime exposes `globalThis.agent`.
- The browser bridge can claim or open a visible ChatGPT tab.

## Python Backend Bundle Missing

Run from `packages/node`:

```bash
npm ci
npm run bundle:backend
```

Then rerun the Python smoke from `packages/python`.

## Selector Drift

Treat selector drift as a product-change blocker. Capture the smallest public-safe reproduction and update selectors/tests together.

## Model unavailable, fallback, or restore failure

Treat `model_unavailable` and `model_fallback` as strict target failures, not generic retry hints. Preserve compact visible evidence and do not accept a response as the requested model. If `configuration_restore_failed` is returned, leave the browser visible and require manual restoration before another delegated run.

## Doctor Preflight

Run `doctor({ check: ["bridge", "login", "upload"] })` before long workflows when browser state or permissions are uncertain. Use opt-in checks such as `existing_tab`, `artifacts`, `file_preflight`, `localization`, and `reports` before targeted workflows. The `localization` check verifies registry readiness, not full localized selector coverage. The `file_preflight` check validates supplied local file metadata without opening ChatGPT or attempting upload.

## Attachment Path Rejected

If a Windows-looking path is rejected on macOS/Linux, do not retry with the same string. Convert it to the backend host's real path, for example `/home/you/file.pdf` for a Linux/WSL backend. The backend rejects ambiguous Windows forms such as `C:Users\you\file.pdf`, root-relative paths like `\tmp\file.pdf`, and empty or relative paths.

## File Upload Blocked

Check both permission gates:

1. Chrome `chrome://extensions` > Codex/browser bridge extension > **Details** > **Allow access to file URLs**.
2. Codex settings > **Computer Use > Google Chrome > Permissions > Uploads**.

The SDK should report a structured permission blocker when either gate is missing. Do not retry uploads repeatedly without changing the permission state.
